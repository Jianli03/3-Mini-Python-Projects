# 3-Mini-Python-Projects
3 short, fun, and interesting projects to work on.


1. Simple dice

  The game involves multiple players taking turns to roll a die, accumulating points during their turn. If a player rolls a 1, they lose the points for that turn. The first player to reach or exceed a total score of 30 wins, but the game ensures all players get an equal number of turns.


2. MadLibs generator

  A MadLibs generator is a tool or program that creates MadLibs, which are fill-in-the-blank stories. The basic idea of a MadLib is to create a funny or nonsensical story by having users provide words that fit certain parts of speech (like nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) without knowing the context of the story.

  The story.txt file contains a story template, you can use your own template.

  A MadLibs generator can be created using various programming languages and tools, such as Python, JavaScript, or even simple HTML forms. It can be a fun way to practice parts of speech and creativity.

3. mathquiz

  Mathquiz uses the eval() function to generate problems with operators. This function avoid using a bunch of "if else" or switch statements like java would have to do.

  Remember that using eval() (or similar mechanisms) can be dangerous if you're evaluating untrusted input, as it can execute arbitrary code.
